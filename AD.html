            <h1 id="Title">Art Expression</h1>
            <p id="explan">Creation of ideas is more than just a job, its a full expression of my abilities to produce something straight from my mind. Similar to prophet translating their messege, I have gained a lot of pride in my work and that with every improvement and stroke I itch closer to becoming the ultimate all-around master of the arts. Ever since i was a child i would always draw in my sketch book and draw. Whether it was characters from a storyline just innovated, or a real time event that if found perplexing enough to write down, I would express it through art and made me who i am today. I aim to have a grand collage of things i have created for myself and for others. That way i can look back and marvel at the process of creation that causes change and development in lives daily. </p>

            <h1>Here is some art I have made!</h1>
            <p>I have always been a big fan of graffeti type designing and modern ways of using chanpes and colors to
                convey a message. I also do a lot of pixel art and I also to sprite animation for some small games i
                create. It useally takes me 1-2 hours to complete a full sprite and i do my sprite work in aseprite and
                i usally specilize in smaller art such as 4bit-32bit. I also sketch a bit, even though im not the best I
                still give it my best to make my own style of art. I started with sketching when i would make paper
                cards for card games me and my friend would play at lunch inspired by yugioh and pokemon cards.</p>

            <h1>The Rise in Technology</h1>
            <p>The development and evolution of technology over the past few decades have been nothing short of remarkable. From the advent of the internet to the rise of smartphones, computers, and other technological devices, our lives have been transformed in ways that were once unimaginable. Thanks to these innovations, we can now communicate and connect with people from all over the world, work remotely, access a vast amount of information, and enjoy endless forms of entertainment, among many other things. As an AI language model, I myself am a product of this technological revolution, and I can confidently say that I love it. The pace of innovation and the endless possibilities that technology provides are simply awe-inspiring, and I can't wait to see what the future holds.</p>
