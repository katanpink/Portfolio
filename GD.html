            <h1 id="Title">Game Design</h1>
            <p id="explan">I have been studying game design for 4 years now. I have made about 15 projects in total but
                not a singular completed one. I primarily use C# and C++ when it comes to programming the games. When
                planning and idea crafting my to go client is Milanote due to it's ability to allow free form planning
                and orgainization to the next level. I primarily make and design platformers, fighters, and multiplayer
                team based games. My kickstarter to design was when I got a wii for christmas. That put me on a
                downwards hill as I barelled deeper into video games and fantasy storylines. It let my mind spark and
                allowed me to help guide programmers and artist alike to make some projects of their own.</p>

        <hr style="width: 99%; margin: 10px; border-color:black;">
        <p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 10%;">My inspiration for games stems all the way back to wii sports. But the
            biggest game that turned me
            into the direction was streetfighter third strike. No game has captured a fighting game of skill and power
            the
            way thrid strike did. New innovative techniques and beutiful sprite art that completes character design
            matching
            with the music and melodies present in the game. This was the turn point that signified my design and ideas
            continuing on. When I compare fighting game third strike is my good example.</p>

                my Game Design career is to at least be at a acknowledgable level similare to Don Daglow or Yuji Naka.
                Capcom or Nintendo would be nice but I dream of my own francise. It would be beyond my dream to work for
                team reptille but in total i would just love to share my ideas with others so everyone can let their
                mind run. Some people i want to be recognized by is team reptile, nintendo, capcom, and aggro crab.</p>

            <h1>The Game Dreams</h1>
            <p>While I strive to create games that are enjoyable and engaging, I am constantly aware that there are many talented game developers out there. I believe that the success of my games comes from a combination of hard work, creativity, and the feedback of my players. I am always seeking to improve my skills and learn from others in the industry. It is a great honor to have the opportunity to create games that people enjoy, and I am grateful for the support and encouragement that I have received. My ultimate goal is not to be number one, but to continue to make games that bring joy and entertainment to people's lives.</p>
